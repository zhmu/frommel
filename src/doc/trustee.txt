Trustee datafiles
-----------------

In Frommel, trustees are stored in one file, $TRUSTEE.SYS. This file will
automatically be protected by the server (therefore, file scan, open, delete
and the likes will not harm it).

This file, $TRUSTEE.SYS, will be stored in every directory. If the rights
are needed for a certain directory, the daemon will first try to open
$TRUSTEE.SYS for in that directory. If no valid entries are found, it will
go one level down and check that $TRUSTEE.SYS file. It will keep doing this
until it has either found an appropriate trustee for the object or until it
has reached the root directory.

The daemon will also check every object the user is security-equilivant to
(but not deeper than that, not the security equilivances of that object)

Supervisor (or equivelent) objects will always cause SRWCEMFA to be returned,
and thus no futher checking will be done.

The format of the $TRUSTEE.SYS files is (all numbers are in byets)

+--------+--------+---------------------+
| Offset | Length | Description         |
+--------+--------+---------------------+
|      0 |      4 | Object ID           |
|      4 |      2 | Rights		|
+--------+--------+---------------------+

This structure will be repeated for each trustee. All numbers are stored in
little-endian notation (therefore, highest byte first)
