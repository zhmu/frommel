This project took up quite a lot of my time... when I was younger, I was quite
a fan of Novell networks. However, having multiple servers here at my parent's
home wasn't quite feasible (as I like FreeBSD a lot as well).

So, I wanted to combine this; but the only Novell-like-servers were MARS_NWE and
LWARED, which were both Linux-based at that time (Boris Popov has ported
mars_nwe to FreeBSD since then).

Therefore, I created my own Novell server, which contained the features I
wanted. For example, it can store the bindery (Novell's database for
users/groups/etc) in MySQL and PostgreSQL!

Anyway, feel free to play with it; I couldn't test this because I no longer have
any IPX networks here and refuse to rebuild a kernel. It compiles fine here
on a FreeBSD box after two minor prototyping thingies.

Feel free to play with it as you like; I'm sure someone will find it portable.
It even had a web frontend (with templates), a console interface etc. Not bad,
for code written during 2001-2002!

Enjoy!
